Poulailler - This is a browser-revival of Nintendo's 
famous Game & Watch Mickey Mouse.

How to play
===========

* Clone the project.
* Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Your goal is to catch the eggs that are about to fall 
before they do, by bringing the basket right under them.
To do so, you may press keys `e`, `c`, `i`, and `n`.  If
you don't catch a falling egg, it breaks, and you will get
penalties for that.  When Minnie is displayed on screen,
you will get only one missed point.  When she is not, you
will get two missed points.  The game is over when you have
six or more missed points.
