=========================================================================

The game mechanics are directly inspired by Nintendo's Game & Watch
called Mickey Mouse.  I wanted to see if I was capable of programming it
in JavaScript.  Then I figured out it might be useful to others to see
how I did it.  In such, this project is meant for educational purpose only.

The program is written in CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org), HTML 
and CSS. It uses jQuery (http://jquery.com).  Tests are writen using the 
Jasmine framework (http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine).

Sounds were created using as3sfxr (http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/).

Most of what I know in JavaScript and CoffeeScript, I know from Jonathan
Perret.  Thank you, Jonathan.
